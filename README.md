# MTS_data
This repository is used to analyze data collected by MTS machine with 2 preprograme tests: Double compression for platisity of the material and Single compression for Young's modulus and half time.
The Code is capable of giving a GUI with time VS force, time VS distance, and distance VS force graph, and a table that can be clicked and link to the corresponding figure. 
Input data should be collected from a MTS machine, with a general folder directory and subforders. 
Each saved test name should be end with dc if double compressed, and sc if single compressed. 
Notes file in .txt should not cause problem, but I haven't test it, so notes should not be saved as a .txt file but .doc.
