# MTS_data
This repository is used to analyze data collected by the MTS machine with 2 preprogrammed tests: Double compression for the plasticity of the material and Single compression for Young's modulus and half time.
The Code is capable of giving a GUI with time VS force, time VS distance, and distance VS force graph, and a table that can be clicked and linked to the corresponding figure. 
Input data should be collected from a MTS machine, with a general folder directory and subfolders. You should enter the height and the radius of the material you are trying to test. 
Each saved test name should end with dc if double compressed, and sc if single compressed. 
Once the export bottom, an excel file named output should be generated.
Notes file in .txt should not cause a problem, but I haven't tested it, so notes should not be saved as a .txt file but .doc.
